This is intended to let you write a simulation/game.  It handles keeping the main loop running, reacting to
mouse events, etc. It gives you an easy way to draw vector graphics, make parts of the canvas reactive to the
mouse, draw buttons, move things around the screen. You just pass your game to it as an object in the html page.
