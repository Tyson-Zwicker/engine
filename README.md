# What is this?

A place to develop the pieces I need to write a game.  The methods developed here are being ported over to
another repo "conductor" which (will) use most of the code written here, but all wrapped up in closures so its
way easier to work with as a consumer.  I will continue to develop the ideas over here, but the end product will
end up in at git@github.com:Tyson-Zwicker/conductor.git
